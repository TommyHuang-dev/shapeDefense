# shapeDefense
simple tower defense game; may be moved to unity after

Long ago, the shapes lived in peace and harmony, but it all changed when the circles attacked!
Only the player, master of all the shapes, may defeat them. :)

In this tower defence you place down towers which can simultaneously defend as well as change the path that enemies follow.
Money is earned by killing enemies and at the end of each round, which can be used to buy and upgrade towers.
Wave will get progressively harder: Enemies will be more numerous and also gain strength each passing wave.
Defend for as long as you can! (currently only 30 waves)

read modding_info.txt if you would like to change around the stats of various towers (WIP, not ready yet)
